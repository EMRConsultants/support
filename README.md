# VersionPress Support

Please [**create an issue**](https://github.com/versionpress/support/issues) for a new support request and we will be on it.

:exclamation: This repo and all you share here is **public** . If you want to discuss something in private, please contact us at info@versionpress.net.

*BTW, we have started this as an experiment as we generally prefer GitHub over emails. This repo is relatively new, please consider it a "beta test".*
